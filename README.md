# Why did I write this?
I have a build pipeline configured in GoCD, I wrote this to get a slack notification evey time a developer commits to SVN and a new build is created. There are GoCD plugins for this, but I found writing a script to be simpler and lighter.

# Setup on GoCD
 - Add a Job to run this script in your pipeline that is doing the Material checkout (groovy reportToSlack.groovy).
 - Create the environment variables: Slack_URL, Slack_Channel, Slack_Mentions
 - Create a slack app if you don't have one, and add set the webhook URL you get from it to the Slack_URL variable
 - set the Slack_Channel to the channel name you want to send notifications to, for example, if the channel is #channel1, then set the value of this variable to channel1
 - in Slack_Mentions, set the list of the people you want to mention in the message, for example: <@nawar> <@ali>
 
# What does the message contain?
 - Commit information (version, person, date)
 - Files changed in the commit
 - Commit message
 - Link to GoCD artifacts generated by the commit
 - Mentions to people
