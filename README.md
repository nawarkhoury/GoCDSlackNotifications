# FlashCards-Swing
Vocabulary memorizing tool for language learning. Built in Java Swing and SQLite.

# Why did I write this?
I was learning german, and needed to memorize a lot of words to have enough vocabulary for the B2 exam. I hate writing on Flashcards and tend to waste them, but it is still the best technique to enhance the vocabulary. I know there is a ton of programs out there for this purpose, but I wanted something that is customized and that tests my vocabulary, not only store it!

# How can this project be useful?
 - If you are learning a language and want to have a cool flashcards program.
 - if you are learning about java swing (I wouldn't recommend it, really, just learn react and electron and angular and other cooler technologies).
 - if you are looking for some example of a simple java MVC application.
 
# How to Build?
just run gradle build using the wrapper.
 
# How to Run it?
Just make sure you have java installed on your machine, and run the jar. you might as well package it in an exe using something like Launch4j for example if you want.

# Why is this written in Swing?
I just felt like playing around with swing at the time. I have re-written it as a web application using Springboot, React and PostgreSQL, check it out, it is committed to the same GitHub account.

#Feature included so far:
 - UI using Swing
 - storing words in SQLite database
 - customized tests based on words categories
 - repeating questions answered wrong in the test
 - keeping word score based on the tests and asking words with lowest score first
